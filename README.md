parkle-api
==========

Python Farkle implementation (alt) w/ tests and API in dev.

The how to play part is not finished yet, but if you read the recursive scoring algorithm it is like reading the rules of the game, and the test logic proves it is correct. Better than I can say for practically any other open source Farkle implementation.

Current and Future dev:
* AI sub-system (Users should be able to write their own AI class logic)
* API + redis state utils (Scalable API implementation)
* Client implementations (for playing the game)
